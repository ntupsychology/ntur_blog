The content of a Hugo based blog for the ntur group. It is currently hosted at
netlify at https://nturblog.netlify.com.

I will try to point our ntupsychology domain name to it, and then I'll try to
point a ntupsychology sub-directory to it, e.g. ntupsychology/ntur.

I used a minimal Hugo theme https://themes.gohugo.io/kiss/, which I modified to
allow for LaTeX'ed maths and syntax highlighted code.
