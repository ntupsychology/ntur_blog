The contents of a Hugo based blog for the ntur group. 

It is hosted at http://ntur.ntupsychology.net, which is a custom domain
pointing to the netlify hosted site https://ntur.netlify.com.

I used a minimal Hugo theme https://themes.gohugo.io/kiss/, which I modified to
allow for LaTeX'ed maths and syntax highlighted code.

Currently, there is no real content, just three test/demo posts.
