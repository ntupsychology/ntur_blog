The content of a Hugo based blog for the ntur group. It is currently hosted at
netlify at https://nturblog.netlify.com.

I have set http://ntur.ntupsychology.net to also point to it. However, this
custom domain has not been fully configured yet.

I used a minimal Hugo theme https://themes.gohugo.io/kiss/, which I modified to
allow for LaTeX'ed maths and syntax highlighted code.
